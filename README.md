# HeadlineHound

HeadlineHound is a Typescript-based project that summarizes news articles for you. With the increase of news articles online, it can be difficult to keep up with all the information. HeadlineHound simplifies the process by summarizing the key points of the article, so you can quickly decide if you want to read more.

## How it Works
HeadlineHound uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and summarize news articles. It extracts the most relevant sentences and phrases from the article to create a concise summary. The user simply inputs the URL of the article they want summarized, and HeadlineHound does the rest.
